<div class="news"><div align="left">We at HackThisSite hope everyone enjoys the <a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120202/04205917638/hey-advertisers-stop-believing-nfls-lies-about-trademark-law-call-super-bowl-super-bowl.shtml'>Superbowl</a> today and can safely overcome their #FirstWorldProblems of determining which dip they should prepare for which chip.<br />
<br />
However, in light of recent copyright law awareness, we wish to remind everyone that, <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000110----000-.html'>pursuant to 17 USC 1 &sect; 110 (5)(B)(i)(II)</a>, watching the Superbowl on a screen larger than 55 inches and/or using more than four speakers in one room for its audio constitutes a public performance and is thereby copyright infringement if not properly licensed -- not to mention merely having friends over to watch it also is a violation, regardless of screen size or speaker count.<br />
<br />
So go enjoy the big game.. ..just, uhh, by yourself on a small screen with two speakers.</div></div>
