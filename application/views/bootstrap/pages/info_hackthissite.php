<h1>The Hack This Site Challenge!</h1>

<p>
Yes, we're asking you to explore the security of our own site to see if it can be hacked. Whoever finds and reports a security hole with our website will be rewarded with big points added to their account and a place in the 'hack this site hall of fame'.
</p>

<p>
We define 'hacking' as manipulating the website to operate in ways it was not originally intended. You do not necessarily have to actually go through with it. All that we ask for (and it is a shame that we even need to mention this) is that these security holes are not exploited in a destructive manner (deleting stuff from the database, taking down the entire site, using this site to attack others, etc). Our philosophy is, we don't care if you come and go as long as you do not inhibit the actual delivery of this website. We want everyone to be able to experience this website so that we may grow more knowledgable and enlightened.

<p>
If you can report the bug, why it is a problem, what can be done with it, we will reward you justly. <a href="#underConstruction">Please submit the bug</a>.
