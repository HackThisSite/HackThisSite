<a name="DC"> </a>Data
Collection
</a></h3>
<p>HackThisSite.org undertakes to collect Your Data by means that are:

<ul>
<li>	fair;
<li>	legal;  and
<li>	transparent.
</ul>

<p><strong>If you visit HackThisSite.org's website</strong>, your web-browser
automatically discloses, and HackThisSite.org's web-server automatically logs, the
following information:  the date and time, the IP address from which you issued
the request, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the URL of
any page that referred you to the page, the URL you requested, and whether your
request was successful.  This data may or may not be sufficient to identify
you.<p>
<strong>Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web-based form</strong>, may
also be logged.  This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.<p>
<strong>Any additional data that your web-browser automatically
provides</strong> may also be logged.  This will be the case, for example, if
your browser has previously been requested to store data on your computer in
<strong>'cookies'</strong> and submits them each time you request a web-page
within a particular domain (such as www.HackThisSite.org).  This data may or may not
be sufficient to identify you.<p>
<strong>If you disclose personal data to HackThisSite.org in conjunction with an
identifier such as your name or your email-address details</strong>, HackThisSite.org
will collect Your Data.  Moreover, any data that becomes available to
HackThisSite.org through any of the means described in the preceding paragraphs may
be able to be associated with that identifier, and hence become Your Data.<p>
HackThisSite.org undertakes to collect Your Data <strong>from you</strong> and not from other parties.

level commensurate with its sensitivity.<p>
HackThisSite.org undertakes to store Your Data only in
<strong>jurisdictions</strong> where data protections are at least equivalent
to those required under the OECD Guidelines.<p>

HackThisSite.org undertakes to <strong>transmit</strong> Your Data in a manner that
ensures security against unauthorized access, alteration or deletion, at a
level commensurate with its sensitivity.<p>
HackThisSite.org undertakes to implement appropriate <strong>measures to ensure
security of Your Data against inappropriate behaviour by HackThisSite.org's
staff-members and contractors</strong>.  These include:

<ul>
<li>	training for staff in relation to privacy;
<li>	access control, to limit access to Your Data to those staff and
contractors who have legitimate reasons to access it;
<li>	particularly in the case of sensitive data, audit trails of accesses,
including the identities of staff and contractors accessing the data;
<li>	reminders to staff from time to time about the importance
of data privacy, and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour;

the event of inappropriate behaviour

<li>	processes to audit, to investigate and to impose sanctions.

<a name="DU"> </a>Data
Use
</a></h3>
<p>Use refers to the application of Your Data by any part of HackThisSite.org, or
any staff-member or contractor of HackThisSite.org in the course of their work.<p>
HackThisSite.org undertakes to use Your Data only for:


<ul>
<li>	<strong>the purposes for which it was collected</strong>;
<li>	such other purposes as are <strong>subsequently agreed</strong> between
HackThisSite.org and You;
<li>	such additional purposes as may be <strong>required by law</strong>.  In
these circumstances, HackThisSite.org will take any reasonable steps available to it
to communicate to You that the use has occurred, unless it is precluded from
doing so by law;  and
<li>	such additional purposes as are <strong>authorized by law</strong> (in
particular to protect HackThisSite.org's interests, e.g. if it believes on
reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfill your undertakings to
HackThisSite.org or have committed a breach of the criminal law).

</ul>
<p>HackThisSite.org undertakes to use Your Data only if it has <strong>demonstrable
relevance</strong> to the particular use to which it is being put.<p>
HackThisSite.org undertakes to use your data in such a manner as to take into account
the possibility that it is not of <strong>sufficient quality for the
purpose</strong>, e.g. because it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or
out-of-context.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">
 
<a name="DD"> </a>Data
Disclosure
</a></h3>
<p>Disclosure refers to making your data available to any party other than

of data transfer, including selling, renting, trading, sharing and giving.<p>

HackThisSite.org undertakes to disclose Your Data only under the following
circumstances:

<ul>
<li>	<strong>in other circumstances that are directly implied by the purpose
agreed between You and HackThisSite.org</strong> at the time of data collection or
subsequently.  Where Your Data is disclosed in this way, HackThisSite.org undertakes
to exercise control over HackThisSite.org's contractors to ensure that their actions
are compliant with these Terms;
<li>	<strong>with your consent</strong>, or at your request;
<li>	<strong>where required by law</strong>, such as a provision of a statute,
or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena.  In these
circumstances, HackThisSite.org will take any reasonable steps available to it to
communicate to You that the disclosure has occurred, unless it is precluded
from doing so by law;
<li>	<strong>where permitted by law</strong> (e.g. the reporting of suspected
breach of the criminal law to a law enforcement agency;  and in an emergency,
where HackThisSite.org believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure of
your data will materially assist in the protection of the life of health of some
person), provided that HackThisSite.org will apply due diligence to ensure that the
exercise of the permission is justifiable.

</ul>
<p>In all cases, HackThisSite.org undertakes to disclose only such of Your Data as
is necessary in the particular circumstances.

<a name="DRD"> </a>Data

</a></h3>
<p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, HackThisSite.org undertakes:

<ul>
<li>	to <strong>retain</strong> Your Data only as long as is consistent with
its purpose;  and
<li>	to <strong>destroy</strong> Your Data when its purpose has expired, and to

order such as a search warrant or sub poena, or a warning by a law enforcement
agency that delivery of a court order is imminent.  In these circumstances,
HackThisSite.org:
<ul>
<li>	will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that

fulfill your undertakings to HackThisSite.org or have committed a breach of the
criminal law).  In these circumstances, HackThisSite.org will only retain Your Data
while that situation is current, and will then destroy Your Data.

by You to Your Personal Data
</a></h3>

Data, subject to only such conditions and processes as are reasonable in the
circumstances.  In particular, HackThisSite.org undertakes to enable access:

inconvenience;  for example, relatively straightforward procedures may be
involved in order to provide you with access through a channel that you have
previously registered with HackThisSite.org (such as a particular email-address),
but may impose more onerous procedures if you wish to use some other channel.<p>
In the event that you dispute some aspect of Your Data, HackThisSite.org undertakes
to take reasonable steps in relation to the <strong>amendment, supplementation
or deletion</strong> of Your Data.<p>

You undertake:

<ul>

provision of particular services by HackThisSite.org to you.

interests.
