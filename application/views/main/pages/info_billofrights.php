We are a non-profit organization that strives to protect a good security culture and learning atmosphere.

1. Higher rankings on the top scores page does not entitle anyone to special privileges nor does s/he achieve any sort of 'nobility'. We are all friends here, all on the same team. Let us not waste our energies battling ourselves, instead let's work with each other towards common goals. However we do encourage users to compete (within reason) purely in the interest of improving their skills.  The hacker emblem is an honor and a privilege - not a right.  If you use the emblem to show your superiority it will be taken away from you.

In general, users have free reign over the site. They decide how it is run, what content goes on it, etc. All we are concerned about is ensuring that the site remains functional and available to all people wishing to learn and grow from this experience. We just want to see that it operates smoothly as possible.
