Almost after three whole years after this document was created, the HackThisSite Development Team decided to brush the dust off the old HackThisSite Documents and restore HackThisSite back to its previous glories. This document was originally created out of the need to develop a more structured, clearly defined set of duties, responsibilities, and access levels for those working for the HackThisSite project, after three years, it was renewed for the very same reason. As the community grows and new projects and controversies are introduced, it is important to maintain an element of order and structure to prevent things from spinning out of control.<br /><br />

These seperate sections to group staff simply define positions, duties, and access levels, and do not imply any sort of hierarchy or social class. Everyone part of staff has a role in participating in the decision making process, and we take steps to keep this organization democratic and have an ordered anarchist approach towards administration.<br /><br />

<b>Root Level Administrators</b><br />

Duties and responsibilities include 
<ul>
<li>maintaining the dedicated server</li>
<li>keeping software up to date</li>
<li>setting access levels</li>
<li>coordinating with developers</li>
</ul>
<br />

Root level administrators also have the same responsibilities and duties as Staff Developers. Access includes complete root access to the dedicated server. However, do not expect them to be online. Especially Kage, he is our host, but he does not carry any responsibility for the site.<br /><br />

Root Level Administrators must exercise extreme discretion and maturity in dealing with staff and users. This unique position requires an enlightened, open-minded approach towards administration to prevent corruption and to set productive and creative examples to other members of the community.<br /><br />

<b>Staff Developers</b><br />
NightQuest, anarkakari, jokerrrr, seth_slade, and Anoresto<br /><br />

Staff developers are responsible for:
<ul>
<li>fix bugs
<li>developing new aspects of the site</li>
<li>perform general site maintenance</li>
<li>brainstorm and </li>
<li>create projects for the site</li>
</ul>
Access includes an independent SVN account. Neither SQL nor forum access should be needed.
<br />

Developers are expected to maintain a level of activity on the site + other projects, and learn to communicate + work with other staff members in a friendly, cooperative and productive way. Developers should read the developer guideline.<br /><br />

<b>IRC Staff</b><br />

IRC Staff have the duty of maintaining peaceful, mature discussion on the IRC network to prevent abuse and immaturity. Separate IRC staff were made to prevent staff developers from being involved and distracted through babysitting the IRC channels so that they can concentrate on positive aspects of the staff. However, this rule does not apply to administrators or moderators.<br /><br />

IRC Staff have the responsibility and duty to be an unbiased, open minded, tolerant, and flexible IRC operator, and must work to resolve conflicts with a diplomatic and NOT disciplinary approach towards administration. We will also develop a system to report abuse of IRC admin in case of power struggle. Currently, you can report these problems to <a href="mailto:ScrAm@hackthissite.org">ScrAm</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Moderators</b><br />

Moderators have the duty of maintaining the various moderator functions on the site. These duties including:
<ul>
<li>accepting or rejecting new articles </li>
<li>looking over user comments</li>
<li>bringing uncooperative users to developer's attention</li>
<li>news gatherings</li>
</ul>
<br />

Moderators can act as the 'eyes and ears' for problems developing on the site or community and can help bring things to the attention to the other developers in terms of bug fixes or other problems. 
<br /><br />

Moderators are often a way to work up and gain the skills and work experience necessary to become a developer on the site, and will often work with developers or do beta testing.
<br /><br />


<b>Sub collectives and working groups</b><br />
Examples: the n-zone, root this box, hack this zine, critical security etc.<br /><br />

Often times, sub-projects of HTS will be created with its own users to help develop test and participate with the project. These official sub collectives or working groups may create its own internal rules and staff and delegate responsibilities within itself. A sub collective may have one or more team leaders to help facilitate the project as well as communicate with the larger group. While people may be part of the 'n-zone team' and have access levels and duties corresponding to their position on the team, it does not necessarily imply being a part of HTS staff. Although it is usually a very good way of getting used to working with staff and provide a step up that may enable you to become part of staff one day.<br /><br /><br />

This is a flexible document and may be changed with consensus to reflect newer circumstances.
