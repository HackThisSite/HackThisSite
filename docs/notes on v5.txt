Notes on v5
===========

1.)  If finding content seems to be slow, use ensureIndex on important 
     fields in a collection.  Some are as follows:
        news:  date
        articles: date
        ...
        comments: contentId

2.)  A good firewall strategy in production would be to drastically limit
     the number of maximum concurrent connections for a user.  v5 uses 
     sleep()s and this could be used to overload memory.
